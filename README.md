# Self Care Center

## Project Description:

  - In this project I designed an app that lets the user choose to see an affirmation or a mantra with the click of a button. The app also allows a user to submit their own affirmation or mantra to be displayed.

  - [Access the app here.](https://mtcawthray.github.io/self-care-center/)

## Functionality

  - The user can select from two choices- **Affirmation** or **Mantra**.
  - Once a selection is made the user can click on the **Receive Message** button and have an affirmation or mantra displayed dependent on their selection.
  - When a message is displayed in the second box, a **Clear Message** button appears at the bottom of the page that will clear the message box when clicked.
  - As an added feature, the user can now submit their own affirmation or mantra.
  - To do this, the user first clicks the **Add Message** button at the bottom of the screen.
  - A form appears that displays a text box to type in a new message, and two buttons to select if the message is an affirmation or a mantra.
  - If neither selector buttons are checked, the app will ask the user to check one before submitting.
  - The messages submitted by the user are then added to the corresponding list (either mantras or affirmations) and now can be randomly drawn upon by the **Receive Message** button.

## Programing Languages Used

  - JavaScript
  - HTML5
  - CSS

## Learning Goals

  - In this project, it was our aim to gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - I got practice writing HTML and CSS to match a provided comp.
  - I was able to understand how to listen to and respond to user events.
  - I was able to add more functionality to the app, i.e. the add message feature and the error handling feature, to further develop my unique skills.

## Planning

  - This project built on what we had learned in our previous project (Hang In There) while adding the challenge of writing our own HTML and CSS from scratch.
  - This took quite a bit of re-teaching on my part to cement my understanding of the JavaScript functionality from the previous project.
  - Conversly, it required a fair bit of pre-teaching and extra research to learn the best ways to manipulate the CSS to visually match the comp provided.
